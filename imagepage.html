		 <p>Adding an image with HTML
          Images are added to an HTML document using the <img> element. The
         <img> element requires the attribute src which allows you to set the
         location of the file where the image is stored. An image element is written
        like this:
        <img src="Location of the image ">
         We can add an image in two ways 
<ol>
<li> Referencing the location of the image in our computers memory 
<li> Referencing the location of the image by adding it's link as the source
</ol></p>
<h2>Example of Referencing the location of the image in our computers memory </h2>
		<div class="grid">
			<img src="assets/images/img7.jpg" alt="" />
			<img src="assets/images/img8.jpg" alt="" />
			<img src="assets/images/img9.png" alt="" />
			
		</div>
