		<h1>Html Elements</h1>
		<p>
			An HTML element is a component of an HTML document that tells a web
			browser how to structure and interpret a part of the HTML document. HTML
			elements can contain formatting instructions, semantic meaning, and
			content. For example, HTML elements are used to denote document parts such
			as headers, paragraphs, and footers and to embed content such such as
			hyperlinks, text, and images. Although HTML can be used to provide
			formatting instructions, HTML standards strongly encourage using CSS for
			this purpose instead. An HTML element is often — but not always — created
			by opening and closing HTML tags, which wrap around a piece of content.
			Below is an illustration that labels each of the parts of an HTML element:
