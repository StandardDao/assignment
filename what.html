			The first step in formatting a web document is to add the
			<!DOCTYPE html> declaration to the first line. Make sure your index.html
			file is clear and then add <!DOCTYPE html>to the first line of the
			document. This declaration tells the browser which type of HTML is being
			used and is important to declare as there are multiple versions of HTML.
			In this declaration, html specifies the current web standard of HTML,
			which is HTML5.


            The <html> element tells the browser that all content it
            contains is intended to be read as HTML. Inside this tag, we will also add
            the lang attribute, which specifies the language of the webpage. In this
            example, we will specify that our site is in English using the en language
            tag. 
            : The HTML <head> element is a semantic element in that it tells
             the browser and the developer the meaning or purpose of its content.
           Semantic elements are used to aid human readability of an HTML
          document
